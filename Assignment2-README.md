Assignment 2: Social Media Influence Model
Introduction:
In this assignment, I developed a social media influence model, which is a coupled dynamical system that simulates interactions between users in a social media network. The model takes into account various factors such as a user's following, cumulative likes received for their posts made in a week, and the number of posts made during that week. By analyzing the interactions between these variables, the model offers insights into how they mutually affect each other and influence a user's popularity and engagement on the platform.

Model Components:
Following: This represents the number of followers a user has. It influences the reach and potential visibility of the user's posts.
Cumulative Likes: This variable represents the total number of likes received for the user's posts made in a week. It reflects the level of engagement and interest in the user's content.
Number of Posts: This indicates the total number of posts made by the user in a given week. It influences the frequency of interactions with their followers.

Model Simulation and Analysis:
I implemented the social media influence model using mathematical equations that describe the interactions between the variables. By running simulations over multiple weeks, I studied how changes in one variable can impact the other variables over time. The simulations also allowed me to explore scenarios such as sudden spikes in following, viral posts, and user engagement patterns.
