Assignment 2: Social Media Influence Model
Introduction:
In this assignment, I developed a social media influence model, which is a coupled dynamical system that simulates interactions between users in a social media network. The model takes into account various factors such as a user's following, cumulative likes received for their posts made in a week, and the number of posts made during that week. By analyzing the interactions between these variables, the model offers insights into how they mutually affect each other and influence a user's popularity and engagement on the platform.

Model Components:
Following: This represents the number of followers a user has. It influences the reach and potential visibility of the user's posts.
Cumulative Likes: This variable represents the total number of likes received for the user's posts made in a week. It reflects the level of engagement and interest in the user's content.
Number of Posts: This indicates the total number of posts made by the user in a given week. It influences the frequency of interactions with their followers.

Model Simulation and Analysis:
I implemented the social media influence model using mathematical equations that describe the interactions between the variables. By running simulations over multiple weeks, I studied how changes in one variable can impact the other variables over time. The simulations also allowed me to explore scenarios such as sudden spikes in following, viral posts, and user engagement patterns.

Final Project: Extended Lotka-Volterra Model with Allee Effects and Stochastic Growth Rate
Introduction:
For my final project, I extended the classical Lotka-Volterra model, which describes the predator-prey relationship between two species, to incorporate additional factors that influence population dynamics. Specifically, I introduced Allee effects and stochastic growth rates to make the model more realistic and applicable to real-world ecological systems.

Allee Effects:
Allee effects refer to the positive relationship between the growth rate of a species and its population density, particularly at low population sizes. In the extended Lotka-Volterra model, I incorporated Allee effects to account for scenarios where species may struggle to survive or reproduce at very low population densities.

Stochastic Growth Rate:
In natural populations, various factors can introduce randomness and uncertainty in the growth rates of species. To capture this, I introduced stochasticity to the population growth rates in the extended model. This allowed me to study how random fluctuations can impact the stability and dynamics of the predator-prey relationship over time.

Model Analysis:
I used mathematical equations and numerical simulations to analyze the behavior of the extended Lotka-Volterra model under different conditions. By studying the interactions between the predator and prey populations with Allee effects and stochastic growth rates, I gained insights into the long-term coexistence, oscillatory behavior, and potential extinction scenarios.

Conclusion:
Both the assignment on the social media influence model and the final project on the extended Lotka-Volterra model demonstrate the use of mathematical modeling and simulations to understand complex systems and their interactions. The social media influence model provides valuable insights into user engagement dynamics, while the extended Lotka-Volterra model sheds light on ecological relationships in dynamic and uncertain environments. Both projects contribute to the understanding of complex systems in their respective domains and showcase the power of mathematical modeling in various scientific disciplines.
