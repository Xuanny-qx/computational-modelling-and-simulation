For Assignment 2, I chose to create a social media influence model. The social media influence model is a coupled dynamical system that captures the interactions between users in a social media network. This model shows how a user's following, cummulative likes received for the posts made in a week and the number of posts made in said week affect each other.

The Lotka-Volterra model is a mathematical model that describes the predator-prey relationship between two interacting species, where the predator's population growth depends on the prey's population size and vice versa. For the final project, I extended the Lotka-Volterra model with Allee effects and stochastic growth rate.
